Hello World!
I write some source code, git push
i do a pull request, fix conflicts
our project has more code.
I code on GitHub
It is very cold today
I think it may snow!
Lovely Haiku, i guess
More incoming
Some Edit, maybe
this is my haiku
it is honestly pretty great
now five syllables

Goodbye World!
